### About me
I am a purposeful and self-disciplined person. I can easily switch from teamwork to individual work. I am always on the lookout for and testing new tools
and technologies in development, which allows me to possess relevant knowledge.
I used to work as a mechanical engineer 5 years. Now I am a digital marketing specialist.
Now my main purpose is get enough knowledge and experience and  to get software engineer work. I pass online courses on [freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
I successfully passed offline course "JavaScript Developer" where I learnt how to develop web apps.
